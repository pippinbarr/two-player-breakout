# Two Player Breakout

## Warning: Flash

This game was exported in Flash and, as you probably know, Flash has been discontinued. As such, I can only provide access to the source code and the `.swf` file at the moment.

If you happen to have an ancient computer that still runs Flash in the browser, or a copy of the Adobe Flash Standalone Player, you should be able to run the game.

At some point I may port the game to JavaScript or similar, and it's possible that the [ruffle](https://ruffle.rs/) Flash emulator will get to a point where this game will run again. Let's see.

## Description
Two Player Breakout was written in ActionScript 3 using Adobe's FlashBuilder 4.5 and the excellent [Flixel](http://www.flixel.org/) library. It was made in a couple of hours and is based on [Breakout code from Photon Storm](http://www.photonstorm.com/archives/1290/video-of-me-coding-breakout-in-flixel-in-20-mins) and uses the same colour choices. It uses sound effects made in [bfxr](http://www.bfxr.net/). The font in Two Player Breakout is [Commodore 64 Pixelized](http://www.dafont.com/commodore-64-pixelized.font) by [Devin Cook](http://www.devincook.com/).
